# JEEVES PROJECT BRIEF (RESET-SAFE)

## Mission

Your mission is to collect **all contact details from every school website** for schools in our database.

Primary target:
- Find and capture valid contact emails from each school website.

Project definition from Simon:
- "I need all the contact details from every school website that is listed in our database."

## Scope

- Data source is the district queue and district files in `data/district_work/districts/`.
- Work district-by-district until all districts are complete.
- Do not work outside this database scope.

## Success criteria

- Every school row has been checked against its listed website.
- Valid contact details captured where available.
- Queue reaches completion across all districts.

## Execution rule

Follow `data/district_work/JEEVES_INSTRUCTIONS.md` exactly.
That file defines strict one-by-one sequence processing and command workflow.
